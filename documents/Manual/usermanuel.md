## 1. Introduction

### **Project Overview**  
This user manual provides guidance on how to operate and interact with the **Quickest Path Calculator** software. It calculates the fastest road between two landmarks in the United States using a large dataset of connected nodes. Its primary applications include trip planning, route optimization, and travel time reporting.


### **Audience**  
This manual is intended for everyday workers with limited experience in informatics or technical systems. The software is designed to be user-friendly, offering a simple interface for non-technical users. However, installation and initial setup may require the assistance of an IT professional. Once set up, the toolâ€™s regular use is straightforward and requires minimal technical knowledge. Instructions are provided in an easy-to-follow manner to support users throughout their experience.

#### **Key Points for the Audience**:

| **Feature**                     | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Designed for non-technical users** | The software is easy to use, with a simple interface and minimal technical jargon. |
| **Requires IT help for setup**    | Initial installation and configuration may require assistance from an IT professional. |
| **User-friendly after setup**     | Once installed, the tool is simple to use for everyday tasks, requiring minimal technical knowledge. |


### **Scope**  
The software provides a **REST API** that allows users to find travel times and calculate optimal routes between landmarks. By using a CSV dataset of road connections, the API processes user inputs and returns travel data in both XML and JSON formats. This enables easy integration with other systems and allows users to retrieve and interpret travel information in a way that suits their needs.

## 3. Installation Guide

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/algosup/2024-2025-project-3-quickest-path-team-5
   cd /2024-2025-project-3-quickest-path-team-5
   ```

2. **Set up Environment**:
    
    Ensure that you have the necessary tools and dependencies installed for both the software and the HTTP server.
      - C++ Compiler: Ensure that you have a working C++ compiler, such as GCC, installed. You can install GCC on your system using the appropriate package manager for your operating system:
        - Windows: Install MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) or use the WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
        - MacOS: GCC can be installed through Homebrew with the command brew install gcc.
      - HTTP Server: Ensure that you have a basic HTTP server set up. You can use any HTTP server like Apache or Nginx. For simplicity, this guide assumes a built-in HTTP server will be used when running the program.

3. **Compile the Software**:
    ```bash
    g++ -o main main.cpp -std=c++17
    ```

4. **Run the HTTP Server**:
    Start the server to expose the REST API:
    ```bash
    ./main
    ```
