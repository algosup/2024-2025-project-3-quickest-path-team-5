## Introduction

This document is intended to provide guidelines for the behavior of all members of Team5. It is important that all members of the team adhere to these guidelines in order to maintain a positive and productive working environment.

## Project Rules and Guidelines

As the Project Manager of Quickest-path, I believe in fostering a collaborative, respectful, and productive work environment. Below are the guidelines that will help us achieve our objectives efficiently while maintaining professionalism.

### 1. **Language of Communication**

- All project-related communication, both written and spoken, must be conducted in **English**.

### 2. **Attendance and Availability**

- Any delays or absences must be communicated to the Project Manager **in advance**. Provide as much notice as possible to allow for planning adjustments.

### 3. **Respect and Professionalism**

- Mutual respect among all team members is a core value. Disrespectful behavior, harassment, or inappropriate language will not be tolerated.

### 4. **Focus on Project Tasks**

- Team members are expected to remain focused on project-related activities during working hours.
- **Personal activities, including gaming or non-project-related browsing**, are strictly prohibited.

### 5. **Accountability and Responsibility**

- Everyone is responsible for their tasks and deadlines. If challenges arise, communicate promptly to seek help or discuss solutions.

### 6. **Trust and Maturity**

- There will be no formal warning or penalty system. I trust that each team member is mature and professional enough to adhere to these guidelines without requiring enforcement.

### 7. **Collaboration and Problem-Solving**
