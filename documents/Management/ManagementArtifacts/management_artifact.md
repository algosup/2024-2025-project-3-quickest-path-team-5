## Risks and assumptions

The following risks could come accross during the project, here is a detailled way to avoid them :

| **Item**                                               | **Type**      | **Impact** | **Management Response / Approach**                                                                                                                                      |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Incomplete or ambiguous requirements                   | Risk          | High       | Hold regular requirements review meetings and secure early stakeholder sign-off to ensure clarity.                                                                       |
| Resource availability or scheduling delays             | Risk          | High       | Monitor team workload closely, maintain a flexible schedule, and develop contingency plans for resource reallocation.                                                     |
| Changes in technology or unexpected technical issues     | Risk          | High       | Allocate time for research and pilot testing; update the project plan promptly if technology shifts occur.                                                               |
| Communication breakdown among team members             | Risk          | High       | Establish clear communication protocols, schedule regular progress meetings, and utilize collaboration tools to ensure continuous updates.                                |
| External dependencies (e.g., dataset quality, third-party tools) | Risk          | Medium     | Validate critical external inputs early and prepare contingency plans in case of issues with third-party resources.                                                        |
| The provided dataset is accurate and reliable          | Assumption    | High       | Conduct early data validation and plan for adjustments if discrepancies arise.                                                                                          |
| The team possesses the necessary skills for the project | Assumption    | Medium     | Leverage internal expertise, offer targeted training where needed, and consider external support for specialized tasks if required.                                         |
| Required tools and infrastructure will function as expected | Assumption | Medium     | Pilot test key systems before full-scale implementation and have support channels available to address unexpected issues.                                                |
| Market conditions and user expectations remain stable    | Assumption    | Low        | Monitor the external environment periodically and adjust project goals only if significant changes are detected; otherwise, assume a stable baseline for planning.  |
