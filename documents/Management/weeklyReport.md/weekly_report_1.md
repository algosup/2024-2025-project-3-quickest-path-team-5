## Objectives for the Week
</div>

- Kickstart project activities by organizing tasks and defining rules for collaboration.
  
- Begin initial research and technical exploration for pathfinding algorithms and graph data structures.

- Start drafting key documentation, including the project charter, technical specifications, and functional specifications.

- Establish coding conventions and quality assurance (QA) guidelines.

## Progress Summary
</div>

- The project officially launched with team members aligned on roles and responsibilities.

- Initial technical exploration was conducted, including attempts with alternative languages. A switch to C++ and C was finalized for performance optimization 
and compliance with project constraints.

- Early design work for graph implementation began, with foundational progress on the graph library expected to be completed soon.

- QA research was concluded, and a preliminary Test Plan was initiated.
Documentation deliverables, including the functional specification, technical specification, and user manual, are in progress.

## Challenges Encountered
</div>

- A change in programming language from Zig to C affected the timeline for technical specifications but did not significantly impact overall progress.

- Some challenges with CMake tooling were noted, requiring additional configuration and testing for quality assurance.

- Maintaining a balance between technical and functional content in the functional specification presented difficulties but is being actively addressed.

## Key Goals for Next Week
</div>

- Complete the graph library implementation.

- Begin development of the Dijkstra pathfinding algorithm.

- Finalize the technical specification.

- Complete the Test Plan and implement GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation.

- Make substantial progress on the functional specification and user manual.
