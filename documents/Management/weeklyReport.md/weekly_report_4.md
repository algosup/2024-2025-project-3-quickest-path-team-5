## Challenges Encountered
</div>

- Occasional team justified absences affected continuous progress in certain areas.  

- Sofware engineers struggled with reviewing the technical specification provided by the technical leader.  

- Quality assurance experienced issues with Boost library integration.  

- Technical leader faced delays with pull requess reviews due to time-spaced submissions and prolonged feedback from reviewers.  

- Coordinating feedback during code reviews and performance tuning required additional time.  

- Fine-tuning the A* algorithm for optimal performance necessitated iterative adjustments.
