# Test Plan

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define and account the different testing strategies that will be employed throughout the project, as well as a link to the result of those strategies.

## Testing

Tests assert the different functionalities of a project as well as the quality of the software. They provide feedback on the state and quality of the software, and can be used to mesure the advancement of a project.

### Strategies

Here is a list of the different testing strategies that will put into place to ensure the quality of the software:

- Smoke Testing
- Unit Tests
- Automated Tests

### Smoke Testing

Smoke Testing or Build Verification Testing or Confidence Testing, is a software testing method that is used to determine if a new software build is for the next testing phase. This testing method determines if the most crucial functions of a program work but does not delve into finer details.

The Smoke Testing strategy will be used to verify that:

- the software launches succesfully without errors / crashes
- the software output a set of instruction to go from a point A to a point B

### Unit Tests

Unit Tests are blocks of code that verifies the accuracy of a smaller, isolated block of application code, typically a function or method. These tests are written by the Software Engineers and are run regularly.

### Automated Tests

Automated Tests are test that are executed automatically every time a certain condition has been fulfilled, in our case it's every time there we want to merge onto the main branch.

## External Tools

During this project we decided to use several external tools help us ensure the quality of the software and the different deliverables of the project.

### Google Test

GoogleTest is a testing framework developed by the Testing Technology team with Googleâ€™s specific requirements and constraints in mind.

It allows us to write and execute a series of unit tests.
