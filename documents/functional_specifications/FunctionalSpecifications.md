# Requirements
The requirements are the conditions that must be fulfilled to meet the school's objectives. These represent the core functionalities we need to implement before the deadline. Any additional features developed beyond these requirements will be considered a bonus and add extra value to our work.
## Core Requirements
| **Section**               | **Details**                                                                                 |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Programming Language**  | The programming language that we must use is C++ to achieve optimal performance.            |
| **REST API Specification**| The software will expose its functionality through a REST API that must run on an HTTP server (localhost). |
| **Data Source**           | A document has been given by the customer. This file contains approximately 24 million nodes. This is the base of our software to develop the quickest path possible in this node. |
| **C++ Source Code**            | The source code must include comments and clear documentation. The code must be of our own creation and use no libraries besides STL. This is necessary for the web server. |
| **Time and Space Complexity**  | We must use Big O notation for the main algorithms.                                                                     |
| **REST API Implementation**    | Our REST API must be compatible with multiple formats like XML and JSON.                                                |
| **Test Suite**                 | We must test our code to validate correctness, performance, and compliance with the approximation rule of 10%.          |
| **Data Validation Tool**       | We need a utility to check the integrity of the CSV file supplied.                                                      |
### Performance Goals
| **Section**        | **Details**                                                                                                        |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Response Time**             | The API must handle all queries within 1 second on a typical laptop.                                               |
| **Approximation Heuristics**  | To prioritize speed over precision, the solution may use heuristics. The returned path should not exceed the shortest path duration by more than 10%. |
### Data Integrity Verification
| **Section** | **Details**                                                                                                       |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Graph Validation**             | We need to verify that the file forms a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and is free of loops.                        |
| **Connectivity**                 | We need to ensure that the graph is fully connected, meaning it is possible to navigate between any two landmarks. |
| **Programming Language**         | Another language besides C++ is acceptable if it is more convenient for these parts.                             |
### Deliverables

For this project all the deadlines for the customer are February 7th 2025. But our Project Manager decided to impose his own deadlines.

# Description 

## Input 

The Client sent us a list of landmarks, tesource and the destination in a CSV file. This one represent 24 million nodes. 

This file is the input of our algorithm. The goal is to classify all this data to finaly find the quickest path.  

The CSV file looks like this : 

![alt text](/documents/functional_specifications/images/CSV_USA.png)


The third information is the time, this is an important data to the algorithm, essential to find the quickest path.

## Output 

The result of our algorithm should be the ordered list of landmarks on the path and the travel time for each of them.

## Algorithm

We plan to use the C++ algorithm for its optimal performance in terms of speed and accuracy.

## Compatibility

The XML and JSON file are two commonly used formats for structuring and exchanging data, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Here's a comparison of the two formats.

# Risk

## Competitive Landscape

Today's market is highly competitive, with many powerful and advanced companies : 

- **Google Maps Platform**: Offers precise, real-time route optimization for various transportation modes. Strong integration with Google services but costly for smaller businesses.  
- **Mapbox**: Known for customization and flexibility, popular with developers. Limited advanced features compared to Google.  
- **OpenStreetMap (OSM)**: A free, community-driven option with customizable tools like OSRM. Less precise in certain areas.

## Product problem

In any project, no issue should ever be taken lightly, as even seemingly minor problems can lead to significant time losses and disrupt progress. It is essential to approach every detail with attention and care to minimize risks and ensure a smooth workflow. Proactive problem-solving and vigilance are key to avoiding unnecessary setbacks and maintaining the project's momentum.

## Data 



Compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is crucial in developing software that interacts with users, ensuring personal data protection and privacy. By adhering to these standards, developers not only ensure legal compliance but also build user trust. The GDPR requires transparent data collection, storage, and processing practices, giving users control over their personal information, which is essential for the acceptance of digital technologies.
