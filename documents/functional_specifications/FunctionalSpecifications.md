# Introduction 



## Document Purpose

The aim of this document is to describe in detail the functionalities and expected behavior of the software, to ensure a common understanding between all stakeholders (all team members, customers, and others).
  

## Project Goal 

The aim of the project is to create an high-performance software solution that calculates the quickest path 
between two landmarks in the United States. 

## Glossary
| Term               | Definition  |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **API**          | |
| **REST**          | |
| **Graph**          | |

Frameworks: Flask, FastAPI, etc.

Data Structures: Graph representation, adjacency lists.

# Requirements 

The requirements are the conditions that must be fulfilled to meet the school's objectives. These represent the core functionalities we need to implement before the deadline. Any additional features developed beyond these requirements will be considered a bonus and add extra value to our work.

## Core Requirements

| **Section**               | **Details**                                                                                 |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Programming Language**  | The programming language that we must use is C++ to achieve optimal performance.            |
| **REST API Specification**| The software will expose its functionality through a REST API that must run on an HTTP server (localhost). |
| **Data Source**           | A document has been given by the customer. This file contains approximately 24 million nodes. This is the base of our software to develop the quickest path possible in this node. |
| **C++ Source Code**            | The source code must include comments and clear documentation. The code must be of our own creation and use no libraries besides STL. This is necessary for the web server. |
| **Time and Space Complexity**  | We must use Big O notation for the main algorithms.                                                                     |
| **REST API Implementation**    | Our REST API must be compatible with multiple formats like XML and JSON.                                                |
| **Test Suite**                 | We must test our code to validate correctness, performance, and compliance with the approximation rule of 10%.          |
| **Data Validation Tool**       | We need a utility to check the integrity of the CSV file supplied.                                                      |


### Performance Goals

| **Section**        | **Details**                                                                                                        |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Response Time**             | The API must handle all queries within 1 second on a typical laptop.                                               |
| **Approximation Heuristics**  | To prioritize speed over precision, the solution may use heuristics. The returned path should not exceed the shortest path duration by more than 10%. |


### Data Integrity Verification

| **Section** | **Details**                                                                                                       |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Graph Validation**             | We need to verify that the file forms a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and is free of loops.                        |
| **Connectivity**                 | We need to ensure that the graph is fully connected, meaning it is possible to navigate between any two landmarks. |
| **Programming Language**         | Another language besides C++ is acceptable if it is more convenient for these parts.                             |


### Deliverables

For this project all the deadlines for the customer are February 7th 2025. But our Project Manager decided to impose his own deadlines.
