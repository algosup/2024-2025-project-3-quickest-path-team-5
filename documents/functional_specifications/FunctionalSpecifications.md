| **API**            | **Application Programming Interface**: APIs are a set of functions and procedures that allow for the creation of applications. |  
| **REST**           | **Representational State Transfer**: A software architecture style, where communication is stateless and resources are accessible via standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, etc. |  
| **Graph**          | A collection of nodes (landmarks) connected by edges (paths), used to represent relationships or routes. |  
| **C++**            | High-performance **programming language**, a generic programming language for building software . |  
| **Localhost**      | Refers to the computer running the software; typically used to test web servers or applications locally. |

| **CSV**            | **Comma-Separated Values**: A file format where data is stored in a plain text file with values separated by commas. |  
| **Algorithm**      | A step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem, such as finding the shortest path in a graph. |  
| **Frameworks**     | **Prebuilt tools** or libraries, like Flask or FastAPI, that simplify application development. Not allowed for the REST API in this project. |  
| **DAG**            | **Directed Acyclic Graph**: A graph with directed edges (one-way paths) and no cycles (no path loops back to its start). |

# Description 

This project involves developing a software solution in C++ to determine the quickest path between two landmarks in the United States, such as Los Angeles and New York. The goal is to design an algorithm capable of calculating the optimal route efficiently, ensuring results are delivered in under one second.

Users simply provide the IDs of two landmarks as input, and the software calculates and returns the quickest path, including travel time and an ordered list of landmarks along the route. Unlike a GPS, this software does not track real-time location but focuses on providing pre-calculated routes between fixed landmarks.
